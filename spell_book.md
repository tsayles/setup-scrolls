## 📚 How to Use These Scrolls

Each scroll can be invoked directly from the command line using the
provided bash command. The command will:

1. 📥 Download the script directly from the repository
2. 🔐 Execute it securely with proper error handling
3. 🎭 Guide you through any interactive options

**⚠️ Security Note:** Always review scripts before executing them,
especially when downloading from the internet. You can inspect any
