# 🖥️ Proxmox Scrolls

This directory contains scripts for Proxmox Virtual Environment (VE) 
management, including LXC containers and virtual machines.

## Purpose

Proxmox scrolls automate the deployment and management of virtualized 
infrastructure. These scripts may include:

- LXC container templates and setup
- VM creation and configuration
- Proxmox cluster management
- Storage configuration
- Backup and restore automation
- Resource monitoring and optimization

## Usage

Proxmox scripts should be run on a Proxmox VE host or with appropriate API 
access. Many operations require root privileges. Always backup your 
configurations before running automation scripts.
