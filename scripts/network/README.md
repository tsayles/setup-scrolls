# 🌐 Network Scrolls

This directory contains scripts for network configuration, management, and 
automation.

## Purpose

Network scrolls help you configure and maintain your homelab or small 
network infrastructure. These scripts may include:

- DNS server setup and configuration
- DHCP server management
- Firewall rule automation
- VLAN configuration
- Network monitoring tools
- Router and switch configuration helpers

## Usage

Network scripts typically require elevated privileges (sudo) and should be 
reviewed carefully before execution. Always test in a non-production 
environment first when possible.
