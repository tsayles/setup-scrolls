# 🛠️ Utils Scrolls

This directory contains miscellaneous utility scripts and helper functions 
that support the broader setup-scrolls collection.

## Purpose

Utility scrolls are general-purpose scripts that don't fit into a specific 
category but are useful across multiple domains. They might include:

- Common shell functions and libraries
- File manipulation helpers
- System information gathering tools
- Configuration validators
- Backup and restore utilities

## Usage

Each scroll in this directory is designed to be standalone or imported as a 
library by other scripts. Check individual script headers for specific 
usage instructions.
